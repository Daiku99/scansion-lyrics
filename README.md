# Scansion-based Lyrics Generation

Welcome to the Scansion-based Lyrics Generation repository! This repository contains the code, data, and instructions for the paper titled "Scansion-based Lyrics Generation."

## Introduction
This repository provides the implementation of the Scansion-based Lyrics Generation model described in our paper. The model generates lyrics that align with given melodies by scansion derived from poetry to ensure singability and intelligibility.
